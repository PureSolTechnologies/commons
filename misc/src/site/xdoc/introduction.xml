				This is a module which contains all minor stuff which does not
				belong to
				another module, but is used multiple times over and over
				again.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>WARNING:</b>
				Because this
				module is a collection of minor stuff which is used by
				other
				modules, it is not meant to be used for projects outside
				of
				PureSol Technologies, because everything in here will be replaced
				by
				an implementations better suited for the task at hand as soon as
				a
				fitting alternative is found. Nevertheless, it can be used, but
				there is no support for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is module also does not conform to the rule of
				<a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning</a>
				. The implementation may change and may be removed anytime.
